Move files from one location on a pc to another automatically. This is intended to be used in a nas environment where you want to upload for example all your renders or dvr recordings to a nas, but they cannot be saved there natively either because it is not supported like in the case of windows media center or because you need faster ssd based storage for it to run normally and then this is a backup soloution that is far superior to windows backup if you want to do a spicific folder although you could do your entire drive.
