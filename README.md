#Auto Backup Program

To run the program run this command and than answer the questions it asks you.
```
python3 main.py
```

I suggest running this on startup to do this on Windows run this command in your run bar which you access by typing ctrl r

```
shell:startup
```
On linux running on startup is more annoying and depends on the ditstro you are using so Google it and if anyone who uses a Mac uses this I will be shocked because all of them use Time Machine.
